# Logo Setup

## Favicon and Logo Files

Place your Evolv Labs logo file in the root directory as:

- **`logo.png`** - Main logo file (used for favicon and navbar)

## Recommended Logo Specifications:

- **Format**: PNG (with transparent background preferred)
- **Size**: 
  - For favicon: 32x32px or 64x64px (will be scaled)
  - For navbar: 32px height (width will auto-adjust)
- **File Size**: Keep under 100KB for optimal performance

## Where the Logo Appears:

1. **Browser Tab (Favicon)**: Shows in the browser tab next to the page title
2. **Navbar**: Displays next to "Evolv Labs" text in the navigation bar
3. **Mobile/Apple Devices**: Used as the app icon when saved to home screen

## File Location:

```
EvolvLabsWeb/
├── logo.png          ← Place your logo here
├── index.html
├── styles.css
└── ...
```

Once you place `logo.png` in the root directory, it will automatically appear in all these locations!
